# echothrust howtos
A list of howtos based on internal research that we open in hopes public contributions will help to keep them up to date.

The documentation in these files is based on a lot of OpenBSD misc mailing list.

Some parts of the documents may be copied "verbatim" from the original mail @misc. We tried to keep our references but there may be some that missing.

Feel free to let us know and we will correct where such cases exists.
