There are three main background processes that required for the RAC to be running. You can see when doing a ps â€“ef|grep d.bin.  They are normally started by init during the operating system boot process.
  - `/etc/rc.d/init.d/init.evmd`
  - `/etc/rc.d/init.d/init.cssd`
  - `/etc/rc.d/init.d/init.crsd`

  $ ps -aef|grep d.bin
  $ /u01/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/crs/bin/evmd.bin
  $ /u01/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/crs/bin/crsd.bin reboot
  $ /u01/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/crs/bin/ocssd.bin

In order to check that the above processes are running correctly you can perform the following command:
  $ crsctl check crs
Once the above processes are running, they will automatically start the following services in the following order if they are enabled.
  - The nodeapps (gsd, VIP, ons, listener) are brought online.
  - The ASM instances are brought online.
  - The database instances are brought online.
  - Any defined services are brought online.

There are five main background processes that required for the database to be up and running. Those are:
   - smon
   - pmon
   - dbw0 (at least)
   - lgwr
   - ckpt
