# Yii2 + NGINX custom selective dynamic error pages
Ok this title makes no sense so i'll try to explain as best i can.

So we have a yii2 application served by nginx and fastcgi. Now as all clean url guides instruct out there, we've configured our nginx server in such a way to catch all requests and sent them to our application following a specific format.

So this means that when a user requests `/targets` the request internally gets translated to `/index.php?r=/targets`. So far so good.

## How it begun
Now nginx also allows you to configure custom error pages and not those god forsaken white pages that kill your eyes. Lets not kid our selfs, these error pages, aesthetically, they look nothing like the rest of your site which make it look unprofessional and in some rare cases attract the wrong type of people to pay attention at our website.

So we went to configure our nginx to use our existing application logic for non existent files and other request errors. The way we did that was by something like the following
```
error_page 404 /index.php?r=$request_uri;
```

One for each of the error codes that interest us, until we hit the error `50x` error status codes. Now usually these errors mean that there is something seriously wrong with the server trying to fulfill the request and as such we dont want to redirect it to back to our PHP application but rather to a static page that will hide our failures and embarrassment ðŸ˜‚

So we went and did something like this
```
error_page 500 501 502 503 ... /maintenance.html;
```

Now these may seem self explanatory until you realize that these error pages are only for the ones that NGINX generates. What that means is that if you try to access the `/something/nonexistant/file.blah`, nginx will detect that this file does not exist and redirect your to the page defined by your `error_page` directive. Similarly yii when producing its own errors uses the same pattern and thus you achieve a nice error page throughout.

However, one thing that we need to keep in mind is that errors that are produced by your fastcgi applications are not processed. This is actually a feature, and allows applications to provide their own status code along with proper error pages. This is how we can show the 404 page and send the same status code as well to the browser, when a user requests a target page that does not exist.

What happens however when your application "crashes" for whatever unexpected reason?
* Say you have a bug that causes your application to crash and cant serve the error pages like it normaly does
* Say your system got rebooted and your php files got corrupted somehow
* Say you wanted to make a change on your live system (you such if you did) and you have a typo
* Say you updated your php and now its missing modules that you're using

In all those situations, you would expect that as long as your application produces a proper status code (eg `Status: 500 Application error`) for nginx to pick up and use the page we defined. But this is not what happens. You get the dreaded white page with the error in `<H1>` saying your application made a ðŸ’©

Luckily nginx has a way to do that, with the parameter `fastcgi_intercept_errors [on|off];`. This tells nginx that if our application produces any statis code larger than 300, then nginx should handle the necessary actions for this code.

## The problem is...
So you go and put that into your config and suddenly all errors have turned into white pages except the ones that go to the static html (like `maintenance.html`).

Whats worse, your nice 404 pages are now back to their ugly white ones...

WTF?

Well this is the reason this is happening:
1. User visits invalid bage (eg `/target/invalid`)
2. The php application produces `404 target page not found`
3. nginx receives a status code of 404 from your application
4. `intercept_errors` kicks in which directs nginx to try and show the error page from your application (`/index.php?r=$request_uri`)
5. but your app, still returns proper status code (404) which go back to nginx again
6. nginx thinks that the `error_page` you defined doesnt actually exist (it returned 404) and shows you the default ugly and white one

So it seems that you cant have both ways, or can you?...

## There is a way...
Define two identical blocks of fastcgi proxy pass one with intercept and the other without.
The one with the intercept runs your normal application, when an error page is produced the error page is intercepted by nginx and is redirected to the other fastcgi block without intercept for your application to show and return proper error codes.

## Show me the ðŸ’¶
The following snippet provides a few extra tricks such as:
* It only allows serving of`/index.php`
* Any other php file returns 404
* Removes duplicate `//` from the url
* Rate limits certain urls and sets the status code to 429 for rate and connection limits
* Doesnt allow direct access of static error pages
* Sets static html for error codes of `50x` to `/maintenance.html`
* All 4xx error codes are served by our application (from another fastcgi block)

This is still under a lot of development and fine tuning but it will save you the hair pulling ðŸ˜€
