# echothrust howtos
A list of howtos based on internal research that we open in hopes public contributions will help to keep them up to date.

The documentation in these files is based on a lot of OpenBSD misc mailing list. Some parts of the documents may be copied `verbatim` from the original mail `@misc`.

We tried to keep our references but there may be some that missing.  Feel free to let us know and we will correct where such cases exists.
